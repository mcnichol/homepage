#My Homepage

## Welcome
This repo is what I use to keep fresh on frontend and get my face out there. Content-wise, it's an opportunity to share some thoughts from my experience and make connections with others. My domain [mcnichol.rocks](http://mcnichol.rocks) is the base for all of my *musings* as well as a quick shot across the bow of who I am and what fires me up! (In addition to that always important self-affirmation)

You'll see it branches off from there based on the topic I'm focusing on. For [fullstack](#fullstack) focused thoughts and articles, you could visit [fullstack.mcnichol.rocks](http://fullstack.mcnichol.rocks) or perhaps you're passionate about [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development). Well guess what, so am I and you can read more about it at [tdd.mcnichol.rocks](http://tdd.mcnichol.rocks)

I've got a list of the domains I focus on below. In addition to that, I've documented how I've set everything up so that if you wnat to start your own passion-fueled sub-domain ramblings, then all you will need to do is fork this repo and consider yourelf bootstraped! 

If you do end up forking this repo, shoot me a message at [twitter.com/codingtogether](https://twitter.com/codingtogether). I'd love to hear about it and follow your journey.

## Setup
If you've made it this far then you must be looking to run your own platform.  Great, let's see if I can help you. My flow is like Java, opinionated and pretty verbose. I've spent a lot of time pairing over the years and I not only think out loud, but my code reflects it. My aim is always to product engineer my pipeline, environment, and applications so that anyone using them can logically guess what would go where and visualize the reason behind it.

Most steps tend to stick with a more traditional approach and treat simplicity and readability as first class citizens. I have a strong desire to avoid *clever tricks* and favor simplicity and readability over cleverness and performance. There are exceptions, but typically due to my failure in expressing my intent in working with the idioms of the language.

Additionally, following and understanding my flow will help me troubleshoot along with you should anything go awry.  

That being said, I ask that you go along with me for the ride and once you hit the end, feel free to give it your own artistic signature. As much as I love to share my style, I love seeing other's art just as much.

## Contributing
If you've found a mistake, don't stop there.  Hit me up with a PR. I screw up **ALL THE TIME**, it's one of the ways I learn.  In fact, I'm so good at screwing up, I've become amazing at fixing [happy little accidents](https://www.amazon.com/Happy-Little-Accidents-Wisdom-Ross/dp/0762462787). So don't hesitate to pair up with me and we can solve together.
