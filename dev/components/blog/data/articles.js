        "Alright, we're started.",
        "Right now it's setup mode getting everything off the ground, expect things to change moving forward. Using the simplicity of ReactJS components alongside the chaos that is transpiling, we've got some SCSS, ES6 running through Webpack using several module loaders...simply put, a boatload of excitement leaving us with a single bundled file. Is it worth it?  Yes!",
        "Over the years my passions have turned into concrete (and heartfelt) opinions. To say that I'm opinionated is an understatement. I would consider myself obsessed once I've committed to something. I think there's a healthy balance of that. ",
        "What do I mean by this?",
        "I believe that in the smallest aspects of your life is where you show your true nature. How you eat your cereal, how many times you hit the snooze on your alarm clock, how consistent you are in brushing your teeth.",
        "These little things are hard to spot, especially in ourselves. We  easily see our strengths and struggle to see the inconsistencies. These inconsistencies are a problem and if we see them, then we must change them and that change is hard. In other words, if we lack the discipline to endure change yet don't want to consider ourselves crazy, we have to ignore these inconsistencies so that we can continue operating as we are without having to change anything.",
        "What is it that Einstein said, 'Crazy is doing the same thing over and over expecting a different result.'",
        "Nailed it...",
        "This blog will be an exercise for me in product engineering the world around me leveraging technology so that I can guide my own behaviors to the target I know I want, even when the habits I've created are fighting to move in a different direction.",
        "This engineering will consist of many different realms, so I've created dedicated sections for each and I'll call each of them out with a little tag."
